Dec 28:

Put a *2 multiplier on the color decoding in decoder_color to improve quality

Change VAERecon to BothRecon for consistency

For figure 7
Encode shape and color separately, setting the other coefficient to 0
Created new variables to store shapeonly and coloronly memories

Change BPret variable to bothRet for consistency

Removed Parentheses from file names  (bad practice)


The binding analysis:
    There was a bug in the computation of accuracy for different items.  I've collapsed same and different into one function and changed the
    way it filters targets so that in the same condition it samples across all digit categories by default.


Suggestion: If we're going to log transform L1 for Bengali, we need to do the same for L1 retrievals of MNIST


Moved the code for generating Figure 9 into plots.py
    (putting it in tokens_capacity.py was a lazy shortcut to getting it done quickly.  This is what leads to unreadable code)

For Figure 11 I changed the name of the variable bs_testing.
    One variable name should never mean two different things (i.e. batch size and then also to be re-used for a list of batch sizes)
